Dies ist zwar in Hinsicht der als DACH-Raum organisierten Twitch-Plattform nicht weiter schlimm, dieser Umstand verhindert oder zumindest erschwert allerdings die Grundlage auf die unsere Community aufbaut: das Vernetzen und Knüpfen von Kontakten mit Gleichgesinnten aus der eigenen Umgebung.

Aus diesem Grund wurde Austrian Entertainment gegründet. Das Ziel ist es, eine Plattform anzubieten, um es österreichischen StreamerInnen leichter zu ermöglichen miteinander in Kontakt zu treten und sich gegenseitig kennenzulernen. Twitch ist leider immer wieder von starkem Konkurrenzdenken geprägt, wogegen wir uns mit dem Motto „Gemeinsam mehr erreichen “ strikt entgegenstellen.

Unsere Community richtet sich an sämtliche StreamerInnen aus Österreich: egal ob man eben erst begonnen hat zu streamen oder schon „ein alter Hase“ ist, bei uns sind alle willkommen. Durch diese bunte Mischung, Experten in verschiedenen fachspezifischen Bereichen und den zahlreichen, unterschiedlichen Ausrichtungen unserer StreamerInnen eignet sich Austrian Entertainment hervorragend, um Feedback und Kritik sowie Anregungen, Ideen und Hilfestellungen zu erhalten, aber auch anzubieten.

Die Community arbeitet jedoch nicht nur nach innen und untereinander, sondern auch an der Sichtbarkeit und Positionierung nach außen wird gearbeitet, wovon nicht nur die Community selbst, sondern insbesondere die einzelnen Mitglieder profitieren sollen. Zudem engagiert sich Austrian Entertainment für karitative Zwecke, indem sogenannte „Charity Events“ (mit-)organisiert werden. Austrian Entertainment soll jedoch keineswegs die persönlichen Communities der Mitglieder ersetzen, sondern den eigenen Bekannten- und Freundeskreis erweitern und im hobby- oder auch professionellem Sinne, die eigene Community ergänzen.

Wenn wir dein Interesse für die Community wecken konnten, dann melde dich bei uns! Wir sind stets auf der Suche neuen kreativen Köpfen, die auf Twitch zu unterhalten wissen.Mehr Informationen findet ihr unter: [www.austrianentertainment.net](https://www.austrianentertainment.net)";austrianentertainment;Austrian Entertainment

On Twitch and other livestreaming platforms, lurking is the action of passively viewing a live stream without engaging the streamer. Since September 4, 2017, we have supported social networking and channel development to help advance our members. Lurkforce is supplemental to the streamer’s content and does not participate in “lurk 4 lurk,” mass lurking, nor third party tools to inflate viewership.

### **[Connect to the Discord Server for a Twitch Team Invite](https://discord.gg/lurkforce)**

After joining the Discord server, read #information for details.

**Twitch Team Rules &amp; Guidelines (Updated 8/11/2020)**

*   Members are required to join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/lurkforce) in order to be informed of recent changes, engage with other members, &amp; contact staff members. Being interactive on the Discord server increases your visibility to other members. Inactivity of 1 year and leaving the Discord server may result in being removed from the Twitch team.
*   Members must have at least 20 live streams per year to remain on the Twitch team.
*   The following content is not allowed on the Twitch team: AFK streams lasting for an excessive amount of time, digital music streams, host raffle streams,  the promoting of fake engagements, &amp; statistic streams.
*   Respect the rules and moderators of each streamer’s channel. Lurkforce discourages members from promoting on channels that do not permit it. Each streamer is unique, so members are expected to respect the rules of the channel. As a streamer, set rule(s) to state if promotions are allowed or not.
*   Follow Twitch’s [Terms of Service](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/), [DMCA Guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/dmca-guidelines/), and [Community Guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/) when conducting streams.
*   The !Lurk command is common in our members’ channels. Members may opt in to create a chat bot command that is triggered when a community member says “!lurk” in chat to acknowledge lurkers.

The Rage Club is a **diverse gathering** of both the saltiest of gamers and the most laid-back of players, **getting cosy** and **connecting** through gaming experiences on Twitch.

Here you’ll find **comfy, positive vibes** combined with light-hearted banter and an abundance of fails and rage quit moments.  We play for fun, with **personality and engagement** at the forefront of our content. We know we’re not perfect - we fail, we rage, we mess up - but we do it together!  We **face challenges head-on**, with the community rallying behind each other even in the most rage-inducing times.

The team advocates for **inclusion, diversity and a variety of skill levels, abilities and interests**. Gaming is for everyone - the aim is to provide a place for like-minded streamers to create, motivate and **collaborate together**.

In general, streamers act in a way that would be appropriate for all ages, regardless of what content is being streamed. Allowing games with ratings up to M (as defined by the ESRB) is at the streamers’ discretion. Visit anyone on our team who’s live now, or check out our [team video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKMIowRENXA) to get a sense of what we’re like!

Every family dynamic / workplace dynamic is different. When it comes to media/video game content, some audiences may find material objectionable, while others find it OK. If you do not feel comfortable or are unfamiliar with the game being streamed, try another Family Friendly Live streamer, or kindly leave the stream. **It should also be noted that these guidelines and restrictions do not extend to channels raided or hosted by the Family Friendly Live streamer.**

Grazie agli studi fatti da Pippo e da Marco Ronco, suo braccio destro, si è scoperto come la mancanza di collaborazione e supporto tra i content non solo limitasse la crescita, ma impediva la buona riuscita del contenuto, poiché uno streamer senza spettatori, è uno streamer infelice.

#supportmystreamer è un vero e proprio network, con l’obiettivo di aiutare tutti i propri “guerrieri” nella “battaglia” contro il “male”, ovvero la paura di non venire valorizzati per il contenuto portato in “live”, ma non solo. Il Network mette a disposizione professionisti del settore, grafici, video editor, consulenti strategici ed esperti del mondo web, che agevoleranno il lavoro degli streamer, rendendo così il tutto più facile e accessibile!

Che tu sia uno streamer, un supporter oppure un fagiano, poco importa.. l’importante è aiutare gli altri per aiutare sé stessi!

Our community has a focus on discussions around streaming issues and technical concerns.  Improve your streamer content and production quality, through good production practices and technical understanding.  Everyone has different kinds of experiences to share and there is an overwhelming amount to learn as a creator.

IQ has committed artists providing motion graphics, alerts, design advice and feedback.  We have experts in OBS, Web, Audio, and Video production.  Our robust members website exists to share our content, experience, and advice.

### How can I know these resources are effective?

Since the inception of IQ we have had a huge percentage of members grow their channel and improve their quality.  We have helped streamers grow their channels, network with others, and reach their goals on twitch.  They can tell you themselves how much IQ has impacted their stream! Feel free to ask any member of IQ how they feel about the community and the impact IQ has had on their stream.  Still not convinced?  Look up our team stats on sullygnome, see how we as a group have improved since Nov 2018.
